                <p class="info-right">Wolfgang G&#252;llich was a famous German rock climber known for his
                    groundbreaking ascents, an innovative and dedicated approach to training as well as his raw finger
                    strength. G&#252;llich is most well know for his development of hard sport climbing routes in the

                        target="_blank">Frankenjura</a>,
                    a massive climbing area just north of Nuremberg Germany. At the age of 16, G&#252;llich was already
                    known for his skills as one of the top climbers in the region. At the age of 24 he began
                    establishing many of the world's hardest rock climbs. Tragically, G&#252;llich died at the age of
                    32, only one year after establishing the world's hardest sport climb at the time, Action Directe.

                <p class="info-left">
                    In 1988, G&#252;llich pioneered the training technique of campus boarding. It was this
                    training that contributed to his success on Wallstreet(8c) and <a class="para"
                        href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/107168107/action-directe" target="_blank">Action
                        Direct</a>, the worlds first 9a in the Frankenjura. Campus board training is now widely
                    used in the world of rock climbing training. Climbing coaches consider it to be a top exercise
                    for power recruitment. Campus boarding is an extremely difficult exercise to perform using all of
                    your fingers, yet in a very famous photo, G&#252;llich is seen performing the exercise using only
                    one finger each hand, demonstrating his strength and power.

                    G&#252;llich shattered the boundaries of what was thought possible in the climbing
                    world at the time. From 1984-1991 he established the world's first 8b, 8b+, 8c and 9a sport climbs.
                    G&#252;llich was most well known for his sport climbing, but also maintained an impressive resume of
                    big mountain climbs and free solos. G&#252;llich's legacy is heavily featured in a <a class="para"
